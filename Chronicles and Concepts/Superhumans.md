# Superhumans details

In the mists of antiquity, during an age when humanity was still in its infancy and civilization was just beginning to take root, a group of enlightened individuals discovered the latent potential within the human mind. These extraordinary beings, known as superhumans, emerged during a time of great change and transition, when humanity was still grappling with the mysteries of existence and the complexities of the world around them.

Drawing upon the wisdom of the ages and guided by their innate intuition, these early superhumans recognized the boundless power hidden within the human psyche. They understood that the human mind held the key to unlocking profound insights and abilities, far beyond the comprehension of ordinary mortals.

Choosing to keep their discoveries hidden from the world at large, the superhumans formed a clandestine community, a sanctuary of enlightenment and spiritual growth for those who sought to explore the depths of their own consciousness. This hidden world, shrouded in mystery and secrecy, welcomed all who were willing to embark on the journey of self-discovery and transformation.

As the millennia passed and civilizations rose and fell, the superhumans remained steadfast in their commitment to safeguarding their ancient knowledge. However, over time, the strength of the superhumans began to wane, their powers diminished by the passage of time and the trials of the modern world. Yet, even as their influence waned, their presence endured as a beacon of wisdom and enlightenment in a world often shrouded in darkness and uncertainty.
