# Superhumans details

In ancient times, individuals of extraordinary insight and dedication discovered the latent potential within the human mind. These remarkable individuals, known as superhumans, were not bound by lineage or heritage but were drawn together by a shared understanding of the hidden depths of consciousness.

Around 300 BCE, a group of enlightened beings recognized the immense power of the human psyche and its capacity for growth and transformation. They chose to keep their discoveries secret, understanding the potential for misuse if such knowledge fell into the wrong hands.

Instead, they formed a clandestine community, welcoming those who sought enlightenment and harmony into their fold. These seekers, drawn by the promise of spiritual growth and the pursuit of a higher purpose, became the newest members of the hidden world of superhumans.

Guided by the wisdom of their predecessors, these individuals embarked on a journey of self-discovery and enlightenment, uncovering the hidden potential within themselves and the world around them. Some emerged as beacons of spiritual enlightenment, spreading their teachings far and wide to bring harmony and balance to the world.

As the centuries passed, the ranks of the superhumans swelled with new members, each contributing their unique insights and abilities to the collective wisdom of the community. Yet, despite their growing numbers, the superhumans remained vigilant, guarding their secrets and ensuring that their knowledge was used only for the greater good.
