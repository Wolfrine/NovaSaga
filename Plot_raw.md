Here's the corrected version of the steps:

1. Friends set out for a trekking expedition but unknowingly consume poisonous fruit, causing them to lose consciousness on a small boat drifting along an empty river.
2. A celestial event, amplified by dark forces, triggers a powerful thunderstorm and heavy rainfall worldwide.
3. The intensity of the storm leads to the opening of dam gates along the river, inadvertently propelling the friends downstream.
4. As the celestial event reaches its climax, a global electricity outage occurs, and protective barriers shielding hidden realms are compromised.
5. Unbeknownst to the friends, their drifting boat enters a small hidden realm through a branch of the river, whose barrier has been weakened by the celestial event.
6. Encountering wolf-like creatures dispatched by the dark side to attack the hidden realm, the friends are rescued by a luminary defending the realm.
7. Upon returning home, the friends struggle to comprehend their experiences, only to find themselves amidst a global and permanent electricity disruption.
8. Moved to action by the chaos unfolding worldwide, the friends engage in community service, where they encounter the luminary once more, who introduces them to the hidden realm.
9. Joining the luminary on a journey to a hidden realm city, the friends embark on intensive training and learn of the impending war against dark forces threatening the world.
10. The final confrontation ensues, with the friends, alongside luminaries and allied forces, facing off against the dark forces in a decisive battle for the fate of the world.
