Core Concepts for the Novel

1. Luminaries: Guardians of Balance

Definition: Humans attuned to natural energies (frequencies, auras).
Purpose: Maintain harmony between humanity and nature, preventing imbalance caused by greed, ambition, or dark forces.
Powers: Sense emotions, imbue energy into objects, subtly influence events without direct interference.
Limitations: Cannot display powers openly due to disbelief weakening their influence; interfere only when necessary.
Do: Highlight subtlety, wisdom, and deep emotional connections.
Don't: Portray them as overpowered beings with flashy abilities.

2. Dark Beings: Manifestations of Negative Energy

Definition: Entities harnessing stored negative energies from beings and environments.
Growth: Feed on fear, anger, and destructive emotions.
Powers: Manipulate emotions, create despair-filled environments, grow stronger by spreading negativity.
Do: Explore their tragic transformation and human origins.
Don't: Depict them as purely evil without depth.

3. Artifacts: Energy-Amplifying Objects

Definition: Objects energized by Luminaries that amplify the holder's innate energy.
Effects:

In good hands: Promote health and positivity.

In evil hands: Cause decay, fear, and corruption.
Mystery: Hidden, detectable only by those attuned to their energy.
Do: Emphasize their dual nature.
Don't: Allow easy detection or acquisition without consequences.


4. Global Catastrophe: Cessation of Electricity

Cause: A cosmic event disrupts metal properties, halting electric currents.
Effect: Global technological collapse, forcing humanity to reconnect with nature.
Do: Focus on societal adaptation and rediscovery of forgotten knowledge.
Don't: Introduce easy technological fixes.

5. Human Potential: The True Power

Core Idea: Humans influence the world positively or negatively through actions.
Responsibility: Luminaries guide; humans are the true agents of change.
Do: Highlight free will and responsibility.
Don't: Let Luminaries dominate the narrative.

6. Auras and Energy Perception

Concept: Living beings emit energy signatures reflecting emotions and actions.
Perception:

Eyes perceive light.

Ears perceive sound.

The brain detects deeper energy patterns.
Applications: Healing, influencing environments, sensing hidden truths.
Do: Ground this in human experience.
Don't: Present it as a superpower.


7. Emotional Resonance and Luminary Actions

Definition: Luminaries are attuned to the emotional state of their surroundings.
Purpose: Maintain emotional balance to prevent unintended disruptions.
Effects:

Avoid direct energy usage if emotions are unstable.

Act subtly in areas of disbelief or trauma.

Use direct power when emotional resonance aligns with belief and balance.


8. Healing Over Destruction of Dark Beings

Definition: Dark Beings are corrupted humans who can be healed rather than destroyed.
Purpose: Preserve human essence and restore balance.
Effects:

Weaken and bind Dark Beings instead of outright destruction.

Heal corrupted souls over time at Luminary outposts.


9. Belief and Reality

Impact: Disbelief weakens Luminary influence on a mental level; intuitive understanding strengthens it.
Awareness: Luminaries and dark beings avoid exposure to preserve their influence.
Do: Explore societal beliefs subtly.
Don't: Over-explain their effects.

10. Subtlety Over Spectacle

Tone: Grounded, realistic storytelling with naturally unfolding events.
Focus: Relatable characters with internal and external struggles.
Do: Prioritize character-driven narratives.
Don't: Overuse action sequences unless essential.
