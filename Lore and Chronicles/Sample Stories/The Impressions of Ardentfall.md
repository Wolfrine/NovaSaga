The concept of energy impressions adds a fascinating and nuanced layer to the world you're creating. Here's how this idea can be incorporated into the narrative, reflecting how negative energies work and influence the characters and the world around them:

### **Revised Large-Scale Plot: "The Impressions of Ardentfall"**

**Setting**: Ardentfall, a mid-sized city in the northern United Kingdom, once known for its rich history and ancient architecture. The city has survived the cosmic event, but its streets are now quieter, and the vibrancy that once filled its markets and squares has faded. The older parts of the city, particularly around the ancient stone cathedral and the abandoned manor houses, have begun to feel different—heavier, more oppressive.

**Characters**:
- **Thomas Granger**: A historian and professor at the local university, specializing in the study of ancient civilizations and their understanding of energy and spirituality. Thomas is methodical and skeptical of anything that cannot be empirically proven, yet he’s deeply connected to the history of Ardentfall.
- **Eliza Morton**: A young artist and empath who has recently moved to Ardentfall. Eliza has always been sensitive to the emotions of others, often experiencing them as colors or sensations. She finds herself drawn to the city’s older districts, where she feels an inexplicable pull.

**Plot**:
As Ardentfall adjusts to the new reality without electricity, Thomas Granger notices subtle but disturbing changes in the atmosphere of the city’s historical sites. The air around the cathedral feels thick, and the stones of the old manor houses seem to exude a cold, almost malevolent presence. His research into the city’s history reveals that these places were once the sites of great suffering—plague houses, execution grounds, and places of betrayal.

Eliza Morton, meanwhile, is drawn to these same sites for her art. She begins to paint the city’s landmarks, but her paintings take on a darker tone. The vibrant colors she once loved are replaced by shades of gray and black, and she starts to see shadows in her work that weren’t there before. She’s haunted by dreams of the city’s past, filled with the echoes of people long dead, their anger, fear, and sorrow trapped in the walls around her.

One evening, while sketching near the old cathedral, Eliza meets Thomas. Their conversation reveals that they’ve both been feeling the same unease, though they interpret it differently—Thomas as a historian sensing a shift in the city’s energy, and Eliza as an artist who is unwittingly tapping into the impressions left by past suffering.

As they investigate further, they come across an old manuscript in the university’s archives. The manuscript, written by a monk in the 14th century, speaks of the concept of *Impression*—the idea that all living beings emit energy, and that this energy can be absorbed and retained by the materials around them. In places of great tragedy or intense emotion, these impressions can linger for centuries, subtly influencing those who come into contact with them.

Thomas and Eliza realize that the city’s historical sites are saturated with negative impressions—energies left behind by the people who suffered there. These impressions have been dormant for years, overshadowed by the everyday life of the city. But with the cosmic event disrupting the natural balance, these negative energies have resurfaced, filling the city with a sense of dread and unease.

Their research leads them to discover that dark beings, attracted by these negative impressions, are beginning to gather in Ardentfall. These beings, which thrive on the negative energies, are growing stronger as they absorb the impressions left behind by the city’s tragic history.

Eliza, with her sensitivity to energy, becomes the key to their plan. By focusing her artistic talents, she learns to channel positive energy into her work, using it to overshadow and neutralize the negative impressions. However, the process is draining, and as she pours more of herself into her art, she becomes weaker, both physically and emotionally.

Thomas, on the other hand, uses his knowledge of history to identify the most concentrated sources of negative impressions—sites where the energy is strongest and where the dark beings are likely to gather. Together, they devise a plan to counter the growing threat: Eliza will paint these sites, infusing them with positive energy, while Thomas works to protect her from the dark beings attracted by her efforts.

Their efforts culminate in a confrontation at the cathedral, where the energy is most potent. As Eliza begins her work, the dark beings emerge from the shadows, drawn by the energy she’s emitting. Thomas, armed with an artifact he discovered in the archives—an ancient stone infused with the positive impressions of a long-dead saint—stands guard, using the stone to repel the dark beings.

The battle is intense, with the negative impressions in the stones of the cathedral resisting Eliza’s attempts to overwrite them. But she persists, channeling all of her remaining strength into her painting. Slowly, the cathedral’s oppressive atmosphere begins to lift, the shadows receding as her positive energy overshadows the centuries of suffering stored in the walls.

In the end, Eliza’s work is complete, but she is left exhausted, barely able to stand. The dark beings, deprived of their source of power, retreat, weakened and unable to harm the city further. Thomas and Eliza, though victorious, know that their work is not over. The impressions in Ardentfall are deep and numerous, and the balance will need to be maintained carefully to prevent the return of the dark beings.

The city, now free of its immediate darkness, begins to heal. The residents notice a change in the air—a lightness that hadn’t been there for months. But as they go about their lives, unaware of the battle that saved them, Thomas and Eliza remain vigilant, knowing that the impressions of the past are never truly gone, only waiting for the right conditions to emerge once more.
