# Luminary Training and Selection Process

## Overview
The luminary training and selection process is a comprehensive system designed to identify and train individuals with the potential to become luminariesâ€”enlightened beings tasked with safeguarding humanity and maintaining balance in the world. The process combines observation, mentorship, and self-discovery to nurture the qualities required for luminaries.

## Selection Criteria
1. **Inherent Goodness:** Candidates must demonstrate a strong innate sense of goodness, compassion, and empathy towards others.
2. **Connection with Surrounding Energy:** Candidates should display an ability to connect with the energy around them, indicating a heightened awareness and sensitivity to their environment.
3. **Desire for Self-Improvement:** Candidates must exhibit a genuine desire for self-improvement and a willingness to learn and grow.
4. **Resilience:** Candidates should possess resilience and determination to overcome challenges and setbacks.
5. **Alignment with Core Values:** Candidates should align with the core values of the luminary community, including integrity, humility, and service to others.

## Training Process
1. **Observation:** Candidates are observed from an early age to assess their behavior, interactions, and inherent qualities. This observation occurs subtly and naturally in various environments, including family settings, schools, and communities.
2. **Family Integration:** If a candidate demonstrates promising qualities, they may be invited to integrate into a luminary community for further observation and guidance. However, only the candidate themselves is invited, as other family members may not possess the required qualities. Alternatively, if a family already resides within a luminary community but one individual fails to uphold the values of being a luminary, the entire family may be asked to leave the hidden realm.
3. **Guided Learning:** Candidates undergo guided learning experiences tailored to their individual needs and abilities. This may include mentorship from experienced luminaries, spiritual teachings, and immersive experiences in nature.
4. **Self-Discovery:** Candidates are encouraged to embark on a journey of self-discovery to explore their innermost thoughts, emotions, and beliefs. This process involves reflection, meditation, and introspection to deepen their understanding of themselves and their place in the world.
5. **Progress Evaluation:** Candidates' progress is periodically evaluated based on their growth, development, and alignment with luminary values. Feedback and guidance are provided to support their continued advancement.

## Graduation and Integration
Upon successfully completing the training process and demonstrating readiness, candidates may graduate and be integrated into the luminary community. They are welcomed as full members and entrusted with the responsibilities and duties of a luminary, including safeguarding humanity, promoting harmony, and upholding the principles of light and goodness.

The luminary training and selection process is a lifelong journey of growth, learning, and service, ensuring that only those with the purest intentions and noblest qualities are entrusted with the sacred duty of illumination.
