## Create of secret world

The Ascendants, enlightened beings with advanced consciousness control, recognized the potential dangers of widespread knowledge about superhuman abilities. They feared that if humanity at large were to become aware of these powers, it could lead to corruption and chaos. To protect against this threat, they decided to keep the existence of superhumans hidden and established secret realms where they could live undetected.


## Disruption from dark side
The dark side, driven by their own corrupted motives, bided their time, waiting for the right moment to strike. They understood the power of secrecy and manipulation, preferring to remain hidden themselves while subtly sowing seeds of discord and corruption throughout the world. They saw an opportunity in the current state of global instability, combined with the Ascendants' weakened vigilance and the upcoming supernova celestial event which is occurring after 3000 uears, to launch a coordinated attack and bring about widespread chaos.

The convergence of these factors—Ascendants' caution, dark side's patience, and global instability—sets the stage for the unfolding conflict between light and darkness, with the fate of the world hanging in the balance.
